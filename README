### Metadata Image Optimizer

Automatically converts images to a user-defined format, while also resizing all images above a maximum size.  
Users can modify a number of quality-related settings based on the format used to achieve a balance between size and image quality.  

For a full list of features and examples, see this [Wiki page](../../wiki/Metadata-Image-Optimizer).
